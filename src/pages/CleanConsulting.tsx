                Clean consulting is an organization at UCLA aiming to empower
                companies and institutions to understand and act on their
                connections with the natural world.

                As the lead graphic designer, I created promotional material for
                our project teams and worked on organization branding. I was
                given free range to create a design for our apparel fundraiser.

                Initially, we wanted to keep the hand-lettered aspect of the
                previous yearâ€™s apparel, so I made a few options that would work
                on a shirt, keeping in mind loop size and line weight.

                Clean Consulting, at its core, is an organization for the
                promotion of sustainable action to preserve nature. Because of
                this, I decided on flora and botanical life to serve as
                decorative elements.

              <Text>
                I drew samples from life and image references to develop a style
                that would be appropriate.

                We are a club based at UCLA, so I decided to have the breast
                design be of poppies, the state flower of California.

                I used Affinity Designer and the vector pen tool to draw out the
                design. The sweatshirt was fundraised and printed through
                Bonfire.
