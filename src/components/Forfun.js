          I was born and raised in Roxbury, NJ before moving to San Diego, CA in
          2018.

          I was a huge band geek in high school and participated in the North
          Jersey Area Band, pit orchesta, jazz band, and marching band.
          Recently, I've been trying to learn how to play guitar (with a low
          success rate, unfortunately).
        </li>
        <li>
          My favorite mediums are pencil and acrylic; I'm particularly bad at
          watercolor.
        </li>
        <li>
          I liked reading The Vegetarian, Our Happy Time, and Goodnight Punpun.
          The next books on my list are GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach and Capital.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've been listening to a lot of Polyphia, Ichika Nito, Darren Korb,
          and Still Woozy.
        </li>
        <li>
          My favorite video games are Persona 5, Fire Emblem 3 Houses, and
          Hades. Currently, I'm playing the Zero Escape trilogy and Link's
          Awakening.
