## [cuimn.github.io](https://cuimn.github.io)

This is the GitHub repository for my site, found at the link above :) Originally created in 2017 using vanilla HTML/CSS, I've been constantly changing the design in the hope of attaining my website aesthetic dreams.

Currently, it is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and coded using Javascript.

I'll be creating a "style guide" (if you could even call it that) in the future, with details on fonts, colors, etc. which will be linked here as well.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at [meilincui.99@gmail.com](mailto:meilincui.99@gmail.com) for any feedback or suggestions (or typo warnings).

The following is the default README when a React App is created:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
