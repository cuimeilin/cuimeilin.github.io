			<h3>A sustainable student organization.</h3>
			<p>Clean Consulting is an organization at UCLA aiming to empower companies to understand and act on their connections with the natural world.</p>
			<p>As the lead graphic designer, I create promotional material for our project teams and work on organization branding. I was asked to create a design for our team apparel. </p>

			<h4>Hand-Lettering</h4>
			<p>Something that most, if not all, of the board wanted to keep from the previous year's design was our organization's name hand-lettered. I wrote out our name using a few different hand-lettering styles to provide a range to choose from, that would best suit the design.</p>

			<h4>Sketching</h4>
			<p>Clean Consulting, at its core, is an organization for promotion of sustainable action to preserve nature. The design from the previous year had a lot going on, so I wanted to make it simplier. As such, the concept of nature led me to flora and botanical gardens.</p>
			<p>Below are some sketches of various botanical life that I found appealing. These sketches were not done with the intent to put them on a shirt - rather, I wanted to explore the variety in plant life first, so I could develop a solid foundation in plant structure, as well as develop a specific style for drawing flora.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-6">
			<p>I then combined the hand-lettered name with some of the botanical life that I sketched out as well as found online, and came up with a very rough idea of what this shirt should look like. This design was to be on the back of the shirt, in a position similar to where the Patagonia logo is on their apparel.</p>
			<p>I also wanted to maintain the simplicity across the front and backs of the shirt, so I decided on a basic left-breast flower design for the front.</p>

			<h4>Results</h4>
			<p>I used Affinity Designer and the vector pen tool to draw out the design. After a lot of adjustment, I reached a final product that I was pleased with - see below.</p>
