			<h3>A sustainable student organization.</h3>
			<p>Clean Consulting is an organization at UCLA aiming to empower companies to understand and act on their connections with the natural world.</p>
			<p>As the lead graphic designer, I create promotional material for our project teams and work on organization branding. I was given free range to create a design for our team apparel. </p>

			<h4>Hand-Lettering</h4>
			<p>We wanted to keep the hand-lettered aspect of last year's apparel, so I sketched out a few potential options that I thought would be suitable for a shirt.</p>
			<p>Things of note:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>loops had be large enough to prevent the printed design from being muddled</li>
				<li>I decided on a continuous width throughout up- and down-strokes to be consistent with the uniformity of my botanical style (below)</li>
				<li>ultimately, I decided on the top lettering style: letters were generally of uniform height and the stacked words allowed for substantial bordering detail</li>

			<h4>Sketching</h4>
			<p>Clean Consulting, at its core, is an organization for promotion of sustainable action to preserve nature. I wanted a realtively clean and simple design that was still "pretty" and ultimately decided on flora and botanical life to serve as decorative elements.</p>
			<p>I made some sketches from life and from images references to explore the variations in plant life and to develop a foundation in plant structure as well as a specific style in drawing flora.</p>

			<p>I then combined the hand-lettered name with some of the botanical life that I sketched out as well as found online, and came up with a very rough idea of what this shirt should look like. This design was to be on the back of the shirt, in a position similar to where the Patagonia logo is on their apparel.</p>

			<h4>(Tentative) Results</h4>
			<p>I used Affinity Designer and the vector pen tool to draw out the design and will be increasing the spacing between some smaller line work to ensure everything is printed clearly.</p>
